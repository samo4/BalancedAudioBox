USB connected balanced +4dBu DAC. Also USB powered. And allegedly 384kHz/32bit.

### Background

I have Genelec active speakers that only have balanced +4dBU input. I only use computer (orginally Intel NUC) as source and I wanted a DAC without any extra wires. There are many comercially availible DAC's, but the selection with balanced output is limited and I also wanted USB powered one without any extra features.

### Status

The first prototype is working great, documentation is under construction.

## How to make one

It's an electronics project, so you can use gerbers to make boards, buy components at your favourite distributor, buy "USB IIS Digital Interface DAC Decoder Board Support DSD512 32bit 384K I2S DSD" or "XMOS CPLD USB digital interface xu208 Module I2S SPDIF Output DSD256 Decoder Board for DAC Compatible with Italian Amanero H011" on AliExpress, 3D print the enclosure and assemble everything.
