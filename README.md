# BalancedAudioBox

USB connected balanced +4dBu DAC. Also USB powered. And allegedly 192kHz/24bit.

### Background

I have Genelec active speakers that only have balanced +4dBU input. I only use computer (orginally Intel NUC) as source and I wanted a DAC without any extra wires. There are many comercially availible DAC's, but the selection with balanced output is limited and I also wanted USB powered one without any extra features.

### Status

The first prototype is working great, documentation is under construction.
