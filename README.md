### Background

I have Genelec active speakers that only have balanced +4dBU input. I only use computer (orginally Intel NUC) as source and I wanted a DAC without any extra wires. There are many comercially availible DAC's, but the selection with balanced output is limited and I also wanted USB powered one without any extra features.

### Status

The first prototype is working great, documentation is under construction.

## How to make one

It's an electronics project, so you can use gerbers to make boards, buy components at your favourite distributor, buy [USB to I2S board](https://amanero.com/) or chinese clone, 3D print the enclosure and assemble everything.

STEP files are included, and here's [the link](https://a360.co/3yRnoUF) to Fusion.
